                <b>Hello there! Welcome to my personal website!</b> <br><br>
                I am Naysah Sheikh. <br>
                I am a B.Tech. student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at the Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, 
                with a passion for designing and problem-solving. 
                I believe that technology can be harnessed to create solutions that make our lives easier and more efficient. <br><br>

                Art and problem-solving are two passions that have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. 
                So, ever since I came across coding, I have been fascinated by the puzzles that each code presents. 
                My first Python class in 11th grade and I knew I was falling in love. <br>
                Presently, I am keen on gaining as much hands-on experience as I can in Web Development, App Development as well as 
                Competitive Coding. You can check out my skill set in the "What I Do" section on the Home page. <br><br>

                Other than academics, I also have a keen interest in designing, art as well as calligraphy. So, designing websites and applications also seemed
                like a natural step. I also design t-shirts, posters, cards etc. You can check out my works under the "Projects" section on 
                Home page. <br><br>

                Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal website! I hope you find the content informative and engaging. <br>
                Adios!
